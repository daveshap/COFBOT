Both Blair and Brown are operating in a very impoverished environment. Blair is working with a very weak government that is in a vulnerable position. Brown is the unspoken leader of the opposition. This is a very bad situation for them because they are powerless and can't achieve their goals. A prosperous life for them would include a stable and strong government and a united and stable opposition. They could be encouraged to find common ground and work together.
