This passage and the previous one both show the possibility of increasing prosperity through education and economic investment. Both passages show that this is a long-term strategy and not a short-term one, and that the focus is on the long-term. The G8's plan for Africa is a long-term plan, and will not result in prosperity for a generation. However, it is an essential first step to improving the environment for prosperity. In the short term, the chancellor should be encouraged to seek support from other nations to help provide education opportunities for African nations.
