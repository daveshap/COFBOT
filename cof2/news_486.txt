This passage describes the rivalry between two brothers who are both vying for control of a conglomerate of companies. One of the brothers, Anil, has been accused of being a bad influence on the family, and of being a source of dissension. The family is worth billions of dollars, and the brothers are fighting over the direction of the conglomerate. The family is currently operating in a state of isolation and is missing out on a broader social network. A prosperous life for the family would be one where they have a more connected social network, and have a more dynamic and positive family dynamic. Anil should be encouraged to find a new job that is not in the family business. The family should be encouraged to work through their issues with the help of a counselor.
