The author is concerned with the possibility of WINE infecting their Linux system. This could be prevented by installing a virtual machine program such as VirtualBox and running the Windows operating system in a virtual machine. Another possibility is to boot from a liveDVD, then use bootable USB flash drive to run WINE from the flash drive. This will allow the user to play the game without risking their main operating system.
