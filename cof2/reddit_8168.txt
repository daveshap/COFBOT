This question is a good illustration of the fragility of public sector institutions. According to the article, the Secret Service has been using a legal loophole to pay agents with a combination of salary and overtime. If a law is passed preventing them from doing this, then they will have to pay their agents more. This will increase the cost of protecting the president. The Secret Service has been around since 1865, and it's been a long time since they've had this problem. It's possible they'll find a financial solution. In the meantime, you could write your congressional representative and encourage them to find a solution. The Secret Service could also raise money by selling merchandise or by having a fundraiser. The main thing is that the public has to stay engaged in the issue.
