This person's current level of prosperity is low because they are currently banned from competing in the Olympics, which is what they love most. A prosperous life for this person would include enjoying the Olympics. One thing they could do is accept the fact that they made a mistake, and that they are willing to do better in the future. They should keep training and keep trying. They should also seek forgiveness for what they did. They should also be encouraged to compete in other major sports events.
