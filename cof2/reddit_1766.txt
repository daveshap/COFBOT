This poster is experiencing low prosperity because they are feeling anxious about their future academic performance. They are feeling intellectually inferior and anxious about the future. They may feel embarrassed and ashamed because they are on a "dumb" path. They do however have a good grasp of their situation and have a positive outlook. They should be encouraged to apply to a wide variety of schools, to take any and all opportunities to meet admissions officers, professors, and students who can give them a good vibe about their chosen academic paths.
