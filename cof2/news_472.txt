There are many options for increasing prosperity here. While this country's economy is growing, it is not growing fast enough to alleviate energy shortages. The energy shortages are curtailing the nation's prosperity. Doing something about this energy shortage would increase prosperity. One option would be to work with other nations to find more energy resources. This could be done through the UN, or in bilateral negotiations. Another option would be for this country to take steps to better utilize the energy resources it already has. This could be done by investing in better insulation, efficient lighting, and other technologies. This would also take international cooperation, but could increase prosperity in the short term.
