This passage describes a dangerous situation. Sidney is on the verge of feeling unsafe in the bathroom of a bar. She has mace and a knife for protection, but is not confident in her ability to use these items and feels vulnerable. Her level of prosperity is low because of the risk to her safety. She could be encouraged to get training on how to use these weapons and to carry them with her at all times, and to get a cell phone and call the police. If she is encouraged to get a concealed carry permit, she will be able to carry her weapons more safely and feel more confident. Also, she should be encouraged to get training on how to handle a drunk person and how to get them home safely.
