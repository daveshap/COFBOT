The greenback is being weakened by a lack of confidence in the US economy. A strong dollar is a reflection of a strong economy. The greenback has been weakening since 2002, when it was overvalued. The US government has been letting the market decide the value of the greenback. If the greenback weakens too much, it will have adverse effects on the US economy, which will have negative effects on its citizens. However, it is important to remember that the value of the greenback is not the central issue for this person. Furthermore, the US government cannot directly intervene in the value of the greenback. The best thing the US government can do for this person is to work towards increasing their prosperity by increasing the efficiency and productivity of the US economy. They can be encouraged to find meaningful work that they find rewarding.
