This passage is an example of the effects of the college board's monopoly on college admissions. The monopoly is being broken, not necessarily because the process is bad, but because it is a way for a few people to make a lot of money. The people who are against test-blind admissions have an economic incentive. So, they have a good reason for being against it. The people advocating for test-blind admissions have a good reason for being for it. It's a way for students to get into schools that they would otherwise not be able to get into.
