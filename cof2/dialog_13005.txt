This passage describes the beginning of the genocide in Rwanda. It shows how the genocide was enabled by the French government's support of the Rwandan army. The genocide only ended when the Rwandan army was defeated by the Tutsi rebels. If the French government had halted their support for the Rwandan army, the genocide would have been halted. A prosperous life would not have been possible if the Tutsi were not prosperous. The Tutsi were prosperous because they had a homeland where they were able to practice their culture and practice their livelihood. If the Tutsi were prosperous, those who survived the genocide would have been able to return to their homeland and rebuild.
