This passage is about how humans and aliens encounter each other for the first time. This is an example of how the human civilization is in the early stages of increasing its prosperity. The humans are in this position because they are in the early stages of colonizing space. This increases their prosperity because it opens up new opportunities, new lands, new resources, and new technological advances. The aliens are in this position because they are in the process of leaving their homeworld, which was overpopulated. They are increasing their prosperity by opening up new lands for colonization.
