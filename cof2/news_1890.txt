This project is increasing prosperity by providing up to date information to students who are stuck with outdated textbooks. Because there are no schools with internet access in the area, the data is transmitted via satellite radio. The data is processed at the base station and turned into a format that can be read by the students' handheld computers. This innovation allows students to access global information. The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. The long term goal of the project is to increase education and decrease poverty.
