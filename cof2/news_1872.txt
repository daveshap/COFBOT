The passage suggests that European patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. The passage also suggests that the US based Amazon.com holds a patent for its “one-click shopping” service. This suggests that patenting is a possible route to prosperity. However, the passage also suggests that this threatens the interests of smaller software developers who lack the legal and financial might of larger companies. The passage suggests that the current laws are inefficient. It would be better if the laws were improved to protect the legal interests of all software developers.
