This passage is an example of how externalities can influence the prosperity of individuals. Hodgson is a former manager in England, and he is advocating for a winter break which is not in the best interest of English soccer teams. He is advocating for the break because of his own personal gain, because he is now managing in Norway, which has a winter break. As a result, his prosperity is increased at the cost of the prosperity of soccer players in England. This information should be included in the passage to make it more accurate. Additionally, the passage should mention that Hodgson's former club Blackburn has no winter break, and his players are struggling because of this.
