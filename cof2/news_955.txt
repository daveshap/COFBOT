This passage and the preceding passage both illustrate the challenges of engaging donors and ensuring that they are giving their money in a way that enhances the prosperity of society. While the passage above emphasizes the challenge of regulating donations, the preceding passage illustrates the challenge of getting donors to give in the first place. Donating money to a political party requires a lot of trust and faith that the money will be used well. The commission recommends that candidates for public office should be required to disclose the names of their donors and the amounts given. This would increase transparency in the political process.
