This passage illustrates how prosperity is hard to judge. It's hard to say if England is prospering or not. It depends on your point of view and how you look at it. If we we look at the facts, it's easy to see they are having a lot of trouble and not prospering. But if we look at their reputation, it's very hard to say. Clearly this passage is written by an Australian, who is clearly not a fan of England. But England is still prospering to the rest of the world. It's hard to say if they are prospering or not, but they are at least still enjoying a good reputation.
