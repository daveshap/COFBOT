This person is trying to find a way to increase the accuracy of their predictive model. However, the data set is too small for this model to be accurate. The model will need to be retrained on a larger data set. This is a common problem with data science and machine learning. There is a joke among data scientists that “data is an infinite resource.” More data can help to improve accuracy.
