This family is lacking prosperity because they live week to week and have to carefully budget their money. They are also struggling emotionally as they take care of their infant and toddler. A prosperous life for them would include the ability to save and plan for the future. They can be encouraged to spend less on takeout and frozen pizzas. They could also be encouraged to spend more time playing and having fun with their children.
