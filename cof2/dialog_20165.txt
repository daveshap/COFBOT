This passage is about the character of Nurse Ratched, who is working to curtail the prosperity of the other characters. While the other characters are trying to increase their own prosperity, Nurse Ratched is trying to curtail their efforts. Nurse Ratched is operating within the constraints of the institution, which is currently set up to curtail prosperity. This institution could be changed to foster prosperity, like the change in the mental asylum in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
