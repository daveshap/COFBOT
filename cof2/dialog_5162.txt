This person's current level of prosperity is low. They are struggling to reach their goals. They are also lacking friends. A prosperous life for this person would include a robust intellectual life filled with intellectual peers. They should be encouraged to reach as high as they can, to stretch and challenge themselves. One thing they could do is look for mentors in their professors once they arrive at college. They should also be encouraged not to sell themselves short, and plan on going to graduate school. This outcome will likely result in optimal achievement of prosperity.
