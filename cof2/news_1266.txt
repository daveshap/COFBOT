This passage is an example of how people can be discriminated against for being different. The government's actions will increase the prosperity of the nation because there are too many asylum claims being made. Poverty, however, is a cause of the asylum claims. It makes no sense to increase prosperity in one area while decreasing it in another. It is possible that the government's actions are increasing the prosperity of the government, but decreasing the prosperity of the Roma individuals who are being discriminated against.
