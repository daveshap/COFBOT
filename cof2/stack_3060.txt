The answer to the question is that the quarks are not the only constituents of the neutron. Neutrons are composed of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons. Gluons have no charge, so the neutrons are charged. Cooper pairs are also formed between electron-positrons. When Cooper pairs are formed between fermions, it is called superconductivity.
