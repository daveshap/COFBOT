GM is suffering from the effects of a recession in Europe and rising healthcare costs in the U.S. This passage illustrates the impact of externalities on prosperity. They are hit by problems like healthcare costs which are beyond their control. Their fortunes are also tied to the success of their subsidiaries in Europe, which are suffering from the effects of the recession in the European Union. Their prosperity is dependent on the success of their subsidiaries, which are dependent on the success of the European Union. So at the top of the chain, prosperity is dependent on the broader economic conditions of the European Union. They are also suffering from the effects of the recession in the United States, where they are dependent on the state of the broader economy. A prosperous life for GM would not be dependent on the success of others, but rather on their own performance.
