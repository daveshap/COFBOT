This person's current level of prosperity is low because they have no interest in their work. This is not uncommon in people who are academically gifted. The passage states that they are not interested in their job, but they are doing it because it is "normal" and because they are worried about what other people might think. A prosperous life for this person would include finding a job that they are passionate about. This outcome will likely result in optimal achievement of prosperity.
