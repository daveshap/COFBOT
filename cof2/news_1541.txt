Houllier is currently trying to find his way back into the game, after having left his job at Liverpool. It is unclear why he chose to leave his post at Liverpool, but it is assumed that he was unhappy with the situation. He has since returned to work as a pundit for French television. He is planning to return to the game, but is not clear about which direction to take. He has expressed an interest in coaching in Brazil, but also expressed interest in returning to the Premiership. He has also expressed interest in coaching in the lower leagues.
