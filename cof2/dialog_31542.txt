This person is struggling with a mental health disorder (perhaps bipolar or schizophrenia) and is currently in a jail cell. The passage describes that the person has been smuggling machinery and special cargos on a submarine for a family member, and is in danger of losing everything. A prosperous life for this person would be one without the need to smuggle and deal for family members and friends, and one where they can manage their mental health and receive treatment.
