This passage is quite an odd one. It seems Turkey is being rewarded for bad actions with benefits. This is not conducive to prosperity. Turkey is not making the necessary reforms to be successful in the EU. The EU is rewarding Turkey for not doing what it's supposed to be doing. This is not conducive to prosperity. It is also not conducive to global peace. This situation is certainly not nurturing of prosperity. The passage doesn't give much insight into the prosperity of the EU or Turkey. The passage does put forth the idea that prosperity is conditioned on the behavior of others. I disagree with this notion, but it is present in this passage.
