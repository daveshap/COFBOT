Despite being a gold medal winning athlete, Jones is not prosperous. She is being sued for defamation, which seems to have been caused by a recent television appearance by Conte where he made allegations about her drug use. She has suffered a decline in prosperity due to the allegations made against her. A prosperous life for Jones would be one where she has her reputation restored. This would likely mean a return to the top of her sport and a new set of challenges.
