This person's current level of prosperity is low because they are disheartened by a low grade on a project. A prosperous life for this person would include a rigorous intellectual life filled with intellectual peers. They should be encouraged to reach as high as they can, to stretch and challenge themselves. One thing they could do is find a mentor in their professor to help them in their major, and plan on going to graduate school. This outcome will likely result in optimal achievement of prosperity.
