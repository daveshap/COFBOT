This passage comes from an article about a tennis match, but it can easily be applied to life. This person is feeling very emotional and happy with the results of their efforts. They are also feeling very down and hopeless. They are feeling a great deal of internal stress. This is a very common feeling among young people, especially those who are first learning to manage their own lives. It is important to allow them to experience this type of internal pressure, but it is equally important to encourage them to develop a sense of internal control. They should be encouraged to develop a more positive attitude toward life and a more optimistic view of their opportunities. They should be encouraged to make a conscious effort to feel good about themselves and their achievements. It is possible they are suffering from depression or anxiety and need help.
