This passage is about a preoperative, postoperative, and post-operative diagnosis of a child who has a distal radius fracture that is displaced. The patient was diagnosed pre-operatively, and she was given a closed reduction and placed in a long-arm cast. This passage goes on to say that the patient was in perfect alignment after the closed reduction and placed in a long-arm cast. It also states that the patient's radial deviation was well corrected. Finally, the plans for this patient go on to say that she will be discharged home and will return in three weeks for the cast to be removed and a clinical examination. She would likely be placed into a wrist-guard at that time. She has a prescription for Tylenol with codeine elixir.
