This person is suffering from a lack of financial resources. They have been trying to change their ways and have been working to have a more fiscally responsible life. They have been living from paycheck to paycheck and have been struggling to pay bills and otherwise live comfortably. In the last year, they have started to work on their budget and have been able to save money to eventually move out. This stimulus check has been a huge help towards that goal.

This will help a great deal with their financial situation and will help them to be able to focus more on their well being.
