This person is suffering from rectal bleeding and a possible hernia as well as a gastrointestinal infection. They report that they have already received a colonoscopy and that was normal. It is unclear if their rectal bleeding is due to the hernia or the infection. It is also unclear if they have a PUD (Peptic ulcer disease). The patient needs to be examined and monitored and if necessary, a CT scan should be performed to diagnose and monitor for any other medical conditions.
