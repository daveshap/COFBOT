This person is suffering from a lack of understanding about electronics. They do not know how resistance converts voltage into current and vice versa. It is important for this person to understand that resistance generates a voltage drop. When a current passes through a resistance, the voltage at the point where the current enters the resistance is the same as the voltage at the point where the current exits the resistance. The voltage drop occurs because the resistance has caused the voltage to drop. One could think of this as a derivative of current. The derivative of current is voltage. When current passes through a resistance, the derivative of the current is the voltage at the point where the current enters the resistance.
