The patient in this case study suffers from temporal arteritis. This is an inflammation that can occur when there is arteriosclerosis. This condition can cause strokes when the artery becomes completely blocked. The temporal artery is located in the head and neck region. The patient's suffering is rooted in the fact that they are suffering from chronic headaches and also possibly suffering from an acute stroke. The procedure was done to collect biopsies of the temporal artery in order to rule out temporal arteritis. They were suffering from chronic headaches and the biopsy was aimed at preventing an acute stroke.
