Serena Williams is suffering from a lack of success. She has not won a major title since 2003 and has been frustrated by her struggles in the majors. This is affecting her confidence and her ability to enjoy tennis. She is upset at her place in the world and is beginning to question her commitment. This is a good example of how an increased sense of self-worth and confidence can lead to a sense of happiness and motivation.
