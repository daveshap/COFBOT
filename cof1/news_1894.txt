This is an example of a business that is looking to improve the quality of life for its customers by reducing their suffering. They are trying to reduce the amount of time people spend watching television and they are trying to reduce the amount of arguments people have over what to record. This is a great form of marketing and a great way to improve the lives of their customers.
