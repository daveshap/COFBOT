This person is suffering from chronic abdominal pain. They are also suffering from depression and anxiety. The primary cause of their abdominal pain is likely due to the side effects of the medications they are taking to treat their depression and anxiety. The CT scan shows evidence of postoperative changes in the pelvis. These could be due to the surgery the person had recently. The nodules in the lungs could be due to the lung surgery or could be cancerous. The main thing to note about this person is that they suffer from mental health issues and are struggling to find help. They are taking heavy duty medications and are having adverse effects. It is possible that their issues would be better managed by less intensive treatments. This is something that needs to be discussed with their physician.
