This passage is taken from a short story where the president of the United States orders an airstrike on an Iraqi commercial jetliner. The president is trying to prove a point about Iraq's lack of cooperation with the UN and the United States and his desire to attack Iraq. The airmen and soldiers debating and analyzing the situation suffer from guilt and shame and, ultimately, feel as if they have let down the United States and the world. The president suffers from hubris and a belief that he can do no wrong. The soldiers are being forced to take part in an act that they feel is wrong. It is important for the president to realize that he is hurting the world, not helping it. If he continues to act with hubris, the world may turn against him. If he continues to act with an iron fist, he will continue to push the world away. The United States needs to find a way to build a relationship with the people of the world in order to reduce suffering.
