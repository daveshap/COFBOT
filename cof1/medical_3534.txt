The baby is suffering and will continue to suffer in the future if they continue to have problems with their airway and require a laryngotracheoplasty. If she does remain intubated, it is likely that the surgeon would use a gastrostomy or feeding access to assist with feeding. This is to ensure that she receives adequate nutrition to grow and thrive. This would likely mean that her parents would have to provide her with solid food via a gastrostomy. It is possible, however, that the surgeon could use another method of feeding to ensure that she gets adequate nutrition.
