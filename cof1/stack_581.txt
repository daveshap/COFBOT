The person who wrote this question suffers from a fear of failure and a lack of confidence in his ability to operate the computer and install a program. He says he prefers the tty interface and operating in a terminal because it is familiar and fosters a sense of control and competence. This is a good thing and he should not feel bad about wanting to use the terminal and install a program from a website. If he is really struggling with this, he could try doing it with someone who is more experienced and may be able to help him through the process.
