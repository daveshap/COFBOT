This is a news clipping, so it is difficult to glean the nature of the suffering. We do know that the protestors are protesting the high cost of gas. Is this because of the gas itself or is it because of the canister of gas? If it is the canister, then the price of gas is actually not the underlying cause of the suffering. The cause of the suffering is the fact that Algerians cannot afford to purchase the canister of gas. If it is the gas itself, then the cause of the suffering is that Algerians are not able to afford gas. If they are not able to afford gas, then it is important to understand the dynamics of the Algerian economy and how it affects the people.
