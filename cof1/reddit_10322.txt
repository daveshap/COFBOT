There is a lot going on in this passage. First, this person is suffering from a lack of meaning and a sense of purpose in the world. They feel that the world is a giant working camp and that they are a prisoner in a system where profit at all cost is all that matters. They do not feel connected to the people around them and do not feel like they can make a difference in the world. They are suffering from depression and are considering suicide. They cannot accept the world the way it is and feel that they cannot live in it.
