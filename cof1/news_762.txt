This person suffers from a lack of financial support and a broken heart. The person in this article is the ex-girlfriend of the guitarist for Motley Crue. Motley Crue is a band that has had some success in the past and is scheduled to embark on a world tour. The ex-girlfriend in this case seems to have been left in financial ruin when the couple broke up. She also seems to have been left with a broken heart. She may have been secretly in love with this person for years and has now lost the chance to be with him. This is a good example of how suffering can arise from both the physical and emotional worlds.
