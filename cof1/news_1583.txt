This passage discusses the fact that Gordon Strachan was approached to take over as manager of Portsmouth. It is possible that he was suffering from a lack of sleep and unable to make a rational decision about the position. If this is the case, then it is important for him to rest and recover and to take a step back from the decision-making process. If he is suffering from a mental health condition that causes him to make rash decisions, then he should seek professional help.
