This company is not promoting people who are capable of doing their job at a higher grade because they want to avoid paying the higher salary. This is likely due to economic reasons, but not necessarily. Instead of promoting these individuals, they are forcing them to leave. The company is then able to advertise the job opening at the higher grade. It is possible that this company is also forcing out individuals who are not willing to do their job at a lower grade. Often, these individuals are the ones who are less willing to work late or take on tasks that are not part of their job description. This, of course, would be for the same economic reason.
