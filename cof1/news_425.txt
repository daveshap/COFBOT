The company had previously reported $7.3 billion in profits for the 2003 fiscal year. The new figures reflect a loss of $300 million. The stock market jumped on the announcement but the share price has not recovered to its previous levels. The company had around $22 billion in assets when it declared bankruptcy. Many of the assets have been liquidated in order to pay off the company's debts. The company was accused of using inappropriate accounting methods to avoid declaring financial loss. The company is still under investigation for these allegations.
