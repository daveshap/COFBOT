This is a very confusing passage. The suffering is not clear. Is this suffering due to the fact that Yukos is being forced to sell its assets? Is the suffering due to the fact that the company is being taken over by the Russian government? Is the suffering due to the fact that Yukos has been forced to declare bankruptcy? Is the suffering due to the fact that Yukos' assets have been sold to a company that owns a Russian state-owned company? Is the suffering due to the fact that Yukos is suing Russia? Is the suffering due to the fact that the Russian government is suing Yukos? Or is the suffering due to the fact that Mikhail Khodorkovsky is in jail? This is a very difficult passage to reduce suffering from because it is hard to tell what the suffering is.
