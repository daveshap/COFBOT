The purpose of this passage is to illustrate the suffering caused by a lack of self-awareness and the consequences of such a lack of self-awareness. The person suffering from this problem (the tennis player) is unaware of the impact that her lack of self-awareness is causing. She has no idea that she is causing suffering for those around her. It is also apparent that nobody else is telling her about this problem. If this is the case, then she is suffering alone and the lack of self-awareness is causing her to suffer unnecessarily. If she were to become aware of her lack of self-awareness, she would be able to change her behavior and would no longer be causing suffering for those around her.
