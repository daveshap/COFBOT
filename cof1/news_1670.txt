The ability to play rugby league is a skill and this individual may be suffering from a lack of skill and a loss of confidence and motivation. This could be due to a lack of experience and the fact that they have not been playing for a while. They may also be suffering from depression or low self-esteem and simply need support and encouragement to get back into the game.
