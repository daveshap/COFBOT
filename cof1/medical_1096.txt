This person suffers from loneliness and a sense that they do not belong and that they do not fit in. They feel that they do not have a place in the world and that they do not have many friends. They compare their life to others and see that others have more friends and a better life. They do not feel as if they have a sense of meaning and purpose and feel as if their life is meaningless and empty. This person should find a way to connect to other people. Perhaps seek out friends and connections online through online forums and groups.
