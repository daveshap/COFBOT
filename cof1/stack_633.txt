This person is suffering from a lack of knowledge about how to create a dual-boot. It is important to note that they are looking to create a dual-boot using either Kali or BlackArch with Zorin or Bodhi. These are Linux distributions and since they are looking for a dual-boot solution, they would need to use a Windows 10 or a Windows 7 machine. It is important to note that these distributions do not support UEFI so this person may have a hard time creating a dual-boot with it. It is important for this person to research this further and determine whether they can use Windows 10 or Windows 7 in UEFI mode.
