The person who wrote this passage is suffering because they want to make their town more strategic and they do not know how to do so. It is possible that the town is too large and makes it too easy to overcome the natural barriers. They may want to consider adding additional barriers outside of the town that would impede the trade routes and force armies to enter through the smaller passages into the town. They could also consider adding fake barriers such as fake walls and such as a decoy to draw off the enemy before they can enter the town.
