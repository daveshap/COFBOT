This person is suffering from a lack of knowledge and experience with the Mac operating system. They would like to back up the Mac in order to reset it and start using it as their own computer. They would like to do this in such a way that the files they need to access later on will be available. They also do not want to use the cloud for this backup and would prefer to use a physical backup. They would like to find a way to make the storage capacity of the backup larger in order to hold more of the user's files and data.
