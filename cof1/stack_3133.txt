This person is suffering from the desire to understand something that is difficult to understand. They are asking questions about why atoms emit light in certain colors. They have a reasonable understanding of the basics of how electrons behave in atoms. They have a sense of what is going on, but they do not have a deeper understanding. They still think that the color of the light is related to the energy of the light, which is not necessarily true. It is more related to the frequency of the light. It is possible that they have not been taught the correct theory and are just guessing. Or they may have been taught the correct theory and are just forgetting it. In either case, it is important that they either get a better understanding or find a way to integrate it into their understanding. In any case, they should go about trying to understand this on their own.
