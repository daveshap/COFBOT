This person is suffering from the effects of the economic recession, specifically the effects of an unemployment rate that is higher than average. It is likely that this unemployment is causing the person to feel isolated and lonely which may be causing them to over-analyze the current state of the economy. It is important for this person to take some time off from monitoring the economy in order to reduce the stress that it is causing. As far as their career path, they should not feel ashamed about being unemployed. It is important for this person to help others in order to feel useful and to feel connected to their community. This could be done by volunteering at a shelter or soup kitchen, or could also be done by doing some sort of social work.
