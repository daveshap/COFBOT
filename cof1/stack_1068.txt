This person is suffering from performance issues. They are asking what would happen if their system required more swap space. This could happen due to the fact that they do not have enough swap space for their system to function properly. It is important to note that this person has 64GB of RAM and is running an operating system that requires a minimum of 10% of RAM to function properly. It is possible that Ubuntu is using all of that RAM and is using the remaining RAM for swap. This is an example of an operating system not being configured properly for the system. This person should consider running Linux with less RAM in order to free up space for swap.
