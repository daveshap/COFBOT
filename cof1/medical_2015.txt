The patient suffers from intractable pain due to a compression fracture of the T11 vertebra. They also suffer from mental health issues. This person is undergoing a surgical procedure called vertebroplasty which is designed to relieve their pain. The technique involves injecting polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) into the T11 vertebral body. The PMMA collects at the site of the compression fracture and provides immediate pain relief. The patientâ€™s mental health issues will need to be addressed and resolved after the procedure.
