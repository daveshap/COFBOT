The person who wrote this question is using the Ubuntu operating system. They are concerned that they are using an older version of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy, an encryption program used to secure communications) and would like to update the version of the software they are using. It is likely that they are using PGP 10 which is an older version of PGP. They are correct in believing that the version of PGP they are using is an open source version. Open source software is software that can be used for free by anyone. It is not supported by the company that created the software and there is no guarantee that it will continue to work.
