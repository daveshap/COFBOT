This passage presents an interesting dilemma for this country. It appears that the government is trying to balance the need to maintain an affordable pension system with the need to find employment for the growing population of senior citizens. This is not an easy task. The unions are attempting to use the threat of strikes in order to force the government to back down on the pension changes. This seems like an extreme response. It is possible that the unions are trying to use this as leverage in order to negotiate with the government what they believe to be a more reasonable increase in the pension age. Regardless, the government has an obligation to maintain the pension system. It is crucial that they do not back down on this issue. If they do, it will have far-reaching implications. At the same time, the unions have a responsibility to their members to fight on their behalf. If they do not, then they are essentially abandoning their members to poverty in old age. It is possible that this will be a difficult battle to win
