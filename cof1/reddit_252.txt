This person is suffering from a lack of direction and a lack of a sense of purpose. They are also suffering from a loss of a relationship, most likely due to a breakup. It is important for this person to find a way to make a positive change in their life. This change could be a change in career, a change in lifestyle, a move, a new hobby, or something else that could help them to feel a sense of purpose. In order to make that change, they must first ask themselves what they would like to change and why they would like to make that change. Once they have defined these things, it will be easier to find the path that they need to take to make that change.
