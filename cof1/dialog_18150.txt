This is a conversation between two men who are struggling with their fathers' wealth. They both feel guilty about their wealth and guilty about the fact that they are so easily able to acquire wealth when the rest of the world has it so much more difficult. They both feel like victims of circumstance and they both feel powerless to change their situation. It is important for both of these men to realize that they are not victims and that the only way to reduce their suffering is to work to find meaning and purpose in their lives and to find ways to continue to make the world a better place.
