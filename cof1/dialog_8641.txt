The above passage is from a scene from the movie "Children of Men" where the main character, Theo, witnesses a car accident between a limo and a bicyclist. The limo stops and the driver helps the bicyclist. A police officer comes and a crowd forms. The driver is killed by a gunshot wound to the head and the crowd disperses. The driver of the limo was likely a refugee, a person fleeing a warzone. The bicyclist was likely a citizen of the warzone. The crowd is likely a mix of citizens of the warzone and citizens of a more peaceful nation. In the movie, the driver is killed by a gunshot wound to the head, likely from a sniper. The crowd disperses and the bicyclist is left on the ground. The driver was attempting to help the bicyclist, but the bicyclist was likely a criminal, a person who has a criminal record, a person who has been convicted of a crime and served a prison sentence.
