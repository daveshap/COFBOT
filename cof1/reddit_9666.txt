This person is suffering from a lack of a sense of meaning and a lack of a sense of purpose. They are completing a PhD and are running into a wall when it comes to their dissertation. They seem to be suffering from a lack of social support and a sense that they may be going down a path they do not want to take. In this situation, it is important to find a way to reach out to others who may be able to help them. If they have a particular network of friends or family they can rely on, they should try to reach out to them. If they have a trusted advisor or professors, they should try to reach out to them as well. They could also try to reach out to a professional counselor or a mental health professional.
