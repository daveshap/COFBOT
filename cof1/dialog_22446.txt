This passage represents a relationship that is in trouble. Mary and Clay have been traveling together and Mary has been injured. She is in a lot of pain and feels like it would be too difficult to continue the journey. Clay wants to take her to a hospital but Mary feels that she cannot go with him, can no longer be part of his project, and cannot handle the pain. She asks him to leave her alone by the road and let her die. Clay does not want to leave her alone and explains that he could not live with himself if he left her to die. He also says that he could not have treated them this way in Aspen. He seems to be referring to a situation in which he found other travelers in a similar situation and left them to die. It is possible that he feels morally superior to his earlier self and wants to show Mary that he has changed.
