The first thing that comes to mind is that this is a man (or possibly woman) suffering from PTSD and possibly depression. He is suffering from a lack of social support and a lack of a support group. He also suffers from a sense of hopelessness. He feels like the world is getting worse and that he cannot help it. He may feel overwhelmed by the amount of suffering in the world. Another possibility is that he has a substance abuse problem. He may be suffering from depression or is suffering from a substance abuse problem.
