This person has a socket tester that they do not know how to use. They are afraid of using it because they think it may be dangerous. The socket tester is designed to detect if the ground is connected properly. This is why all three indicators are lit up. There are also two different kinds of sockets. One is the grounded socket and the other is the ungrounded socket. If they are using the grounded socket on an ungrounded socket, then the indicator lights will all light up. If they are using the ungrounded socket on a grounded socket, then the indicator lights will not light up.
