Some of these questions indicate that the person is suffering from a mental health problem. They may be suffering from a personality disorder or some other form of mental illness that is causing them to suffer. For example, they may be suffering from a lack of a sense of purpose and a lack of a sense of meaning. They may also be suffering from a lack of a sense of belonging and a lack of a sense of connection to others. It is important for the person to seek out a psychologist or a psychiatrist in order to find out what the root causes of their suffering are and then to find a treatment that can help them overcome those root causes.
