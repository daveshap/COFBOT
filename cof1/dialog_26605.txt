This person suffers from feeling emotionally distant from the people around them. They feel like they can't connect with anyone and they feel like they can't form meaningful relationships. This could be due to their own difficulties in trying to form relationships and they may be projecting those feelings onto others. However, it could also be due to mental health issues, such as depression. They may need counseling to help them learn to cope with their symptoms.
