This person wants to combine signals from two separate pulses in order to calculate their overlap. They are having trouble determining how to calculate the limits of their system when they combine these two signals. They are concerned that their system will not work because they are combining two different signals. One signal has a finite bandwidth and the other has an infinite bandwidth. They are concerned that the finite bandwidth signal will be truncated when they combine the two signals. It is important to note that this is something that can be done mathematically. It is not necessary that both the infinite bandwidth and the finite bandwidth signals exist physically.
