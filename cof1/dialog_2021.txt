This passage is about a boy named Spencer who is suffering from some sort of allergy. While it is clear that the various health care providers are aware that Spencer has some sort of allergy, they are not taking the appropriate steps to figure out what type of allergy it is. This could be due to the fact that Spencer's mother is not willing to pay for the necessary testing. It is also possible that the health care providers are not taking the necessary steps because they are not completely sure of Spencer's allergies.
