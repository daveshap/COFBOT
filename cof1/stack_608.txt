This individual is suffering because they cannot open files in windows in windows in ubuntu. This could be due to the fact that the windows partition is NTFS and the ubuntu is using ext4. To my knowledge, there is not a way to read NTFS in ext4. It is possible that they could be backing up files to their onedrive folder and these files are in fact in pdf format. If this is the case, the individual could use the open source utility called calibre to convert the pdf to an epub.
