This person is suffering from a lack of direction in life. They are also suffering from the fact that they are not able to connect to people or activities around them. The fact that they are working in a job that they do not enjoy seems to be one of the core issues here. They are not able to find meaning in their work and are, therefore, feeling disconnected. To address this, they could consider changing their major or changing careers altogether. They could also consider finding a hobby or connecting with a social network through an online chat room or social media. They may also be suffering from depression. This could be treated with counseling or medication.
