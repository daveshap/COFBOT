The person suffering here is the surgeon. They are suffering from the fear of having to perform a surgery on a patient who may be resistant to their anesthesia. They are also suffering from the fear of hurting someone who is vulnerable. They are also suffering from the fear of being caught. This is a situation where the suffering of the surgeon is dependent on the suffering of the patient. This person should seek support from their peers, family, or even a therapist.
