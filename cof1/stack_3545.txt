A user sends a request to a remote endpoint through AJAX. The response to this request is unsanitized. This means that the response contains data that is not properly escaped. This could be because of a bug in the endpoint or because of a bug in the application code that is sending the request. The application code is vulnerable to XSS because this unsanitized data is being sent back to the user through the response. The attacker can then inject their own malicious data into the site. The result is that the attacker can get the user to load their malicious data. This can take many forms. It can be an image, if the attacker wants to get the user to click on it. It can be a link to a malicious site. It can be text that they want the user to read.
