This person is suffering because they are not accepting of themselves and are trying to improve on what they think is wrong with them. This is, of course, impossible. They are suffering because they are not happy with themselves and are trying to change things that are impossible to change. This person may, of course, want to lose weight, but that is an impossible goal. The best solution would be to accept themselves for who they are and work on accepting themselves rather than trying to change. If they are suffering from depression, it would be best to seek counseling or medication to help them cope with their symptoms.
