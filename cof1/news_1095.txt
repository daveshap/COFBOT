In this article, a government official is calling for more restrictions on violent video games as a way to protect children from the negative effects of those games. The author points out that parents have a responsibility to keep their children from playing those games as well as a responsibility to teach their children how to make their own decisions. While the author claims to support the UK's "vibrant games industry", the truth is that there is a lot of suffering going on. The author of this article is suffering from a lack of understanding of the games industry and the industry is suffering from a lack of understanding of the government. The government is suffering from a lack of understanding of the negative effects of violent video games and the children who play them are suffering from a lack of understanding of their own rights and what they can and cannot do.
