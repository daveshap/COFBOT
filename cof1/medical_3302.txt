This person suffers from many illnesses and conditions. They are getting follow-up care from their previous doctors, which is a good sign. They are taking their medications as prescribed. They are exercising three times per week. They are also fasting for their glucose monitoring. This is also a good sign. They are doing all of the right things. The only thing that stands out as unusual is their hyperlipidemia. This is a condition involving elevated levels of lipids in the blood. This does not seem to be a major factor in their suffering.
