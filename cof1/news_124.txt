Softbank was not making a profit before launching their bargain service. It is possible that they were not making a profit because they were not spending enough money on marketing. The fact that they would not have made a profit even if they had not spent the money on this service may suggest that they were spending too much in the past and that they were overdoing it in the marketing department. It is also possible that they were not making a profit because they were spending too much on their employees. If the company was previously spending too much money on its employees, it could be possible that they were not maximizing their profits because they were spending too much money on their employees. If this is the case, it may be beneficial for the company to find ways to reduce its employee costs in order to maximize profits.
