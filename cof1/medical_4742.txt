This person is suffering from chest pain and other symptoms and they are seeking help to determine if there is a medical issue. The first question they ask is whether or not they should walk. This is because they previously experienced chest pain when walking. It is important to note that the chest pain the patient experienced previously was not related to the heart. It is possible that the patient experienced some other form of chest pain such as acid reflux or something else that is not related to the heart. If this is the case, the patient should have the doctor check for those other causes. The doctor should also check to see if the patient is experiencing stress or anxiety related symptoms. If the chest pain is related to anxiety, the doctor may prescribe a beta blocker.
