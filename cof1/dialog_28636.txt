This passage is about the possibility of war. The two soldiers discuss the possibility of war and the fight for Kuwait, but then they move on to say that their opinion does not matter because the decision is not up to them. They then say that they should fight regardless because people are suffering. This clearly shows that both men are suffering. They are suffering because they are discussing the possibility of war. They are also suffering because they are not in control of their own future. They are suffering because they are stuck in the desert, far away from their families and homes, and they are suffering because they are worried about their families and worried about what could happen to them back at home. The men are also suffering because they may be called upon to fight a war that they do not think they should have to fight.
