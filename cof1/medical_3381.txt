This patient suffers from many physical symptoms. Her pelvic pain is likely due to the abscesses on her inner thighs. Her mood swings are likely due to her discontinuing lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder, and her dyspareunia is likely due to the physical trauma to her vagina. She may also be suffering from some depression, anxiety, or stress. I would suggest getting her back to her primary care physician, they will most likely treat her mood symptoms with antidepressants or talk therapy. They will likely treat her physical symptoms with antibiotics. Her vaginal trauma is likely due to the abscesses on her inner thighs. They may recommend her to see a gynecologist for treatment of the vaginal trauma.
