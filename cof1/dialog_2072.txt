This passage is taken from a short story written by author Stephen King. The story describes a dystopian future where the government has created a system called R.A.T.H. (Remote Access Transceivers for the Handicapped). When a person is diagnosed with cancer they are given a RATH, a mechanical device that is placed into their body. It is controlled via a remote by a government employee that monitors that person's health and behavior. The main character, a man named Bain, does not want a RATH. He flees from his doctors and tries to avoid his fate. It is clear from this passage that he does not want to be monitored and controlled by a government employee. This is a clear example of suffering from a loss of freedom.
