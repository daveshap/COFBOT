This country has banned the performance of the Vagina Monologues because they believe that it promotes homosexuality and lesbianism. This is ironic because the purpose of the monologues is to empower women. This ban shows that the government is more interested in preserving traditional values than protecting the rights of women. It is possible that the government is also acting out of fear that this performance would bring out the reality that women are oppressed in that country.
