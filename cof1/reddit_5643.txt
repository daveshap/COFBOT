This person is suffering from a lack of direction and a lack of a sense of belonging. They are young and have a lot of options available to them. They may wish to relocate to a new city or even a new country to try a new life. This can be a good way to escape a negative situation and begin a new chapter. However, it is also a good idea to make a plan and a backup plan, as there is no guarantee that the new city or job will be a good fit.
