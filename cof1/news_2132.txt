This passage represents a company's efforts to reduce suffering. The suffering here is caused by the actions of the company's customers. The suffering is exacerbated by the fact that it has become more difficult for malicious hackers to create viruses. This is because it is harder for them to get their hands on the source code for Windows XP. This makes it more difficult for them to determine how to create new viruses based on previous viruses. It is possible that this suffering could be reduced if the company were to make the source code for Windows XP available for free to hackers. This would allow malicious hackers to create viruses based on previous viruses. That way, the company could be protected from new viruses.
