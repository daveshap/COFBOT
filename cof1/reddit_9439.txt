This person wants to separate out the "Paid off my debt" posts that they find annoying. The author of the post states that they find it annoying that people find it difficult to believe that they paid off their debt because it took them a short amount of time. The author states that they want this to be its own sub because they feel like they do not need to be reminded of it every time they visit the sub.
