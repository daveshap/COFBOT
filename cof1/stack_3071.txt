This person is suffering from a lack of knowledge about a topic. At the time of this writing, the last theory of everything was proposed by an individual named Randall Fields. Fields' theory is a theory of everything that is not necessarily a unified field theory as this would require a theory of quantum gravity. This means that the Fields' theory is a theory of everything that does not include a theory of quantum gravity. In simpler terms, this theory is a theory of everything that would only apply to the universe as we currently know it. This person is suffering from a lack of knowledge and a lack of understanding of a topic. The best way to reduce this suffering is to educate themselves on the topic by reading books or going to lectures.
