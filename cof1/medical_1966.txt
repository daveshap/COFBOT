The patient suffers from chronic pain. The procedure that they underwent was a radiofrequency thermocoagulation procedure. This is a procedure in which a lesion is created in the sensory portion of a nerve in order to reduce pain. The goal of this procedure was to reduce pain by creating a lesion in the sensory portion of the nerve. The issue is whether or not this procedure will be effective in reducing the patient's pain. This is an ethical dilemma because they are in pain and this procedure could reduce that pain. However, it is unclear whether this procedure will be effective. If the procedure is not effective then the procedure creates unnecessary suffering for the patient. If the procedure is effective then it is unclear whether the patient will remain in pain in the long run.
