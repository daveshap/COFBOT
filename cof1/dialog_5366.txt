This is a very short excerpt from the film Rounders (1998) and it is a scene where the character of Lester is playing a high stakes poker game with a young hot-shot player named Ace. Ace is a gifted poker player and is very good at reading people. In this scene, Lester is annoyed that Ace is playing a very tight and conservative game and is winning the pot. Ace has a very good reason for playing such a tight game and has a solid strategy. Ace is using this strategy as a way to win the game and beat Lester at his own game. This scene is an example of someone using a strategy as a way to win a game and not as a way to cause suffering.
