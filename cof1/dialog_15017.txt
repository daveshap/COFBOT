This passage is very short and the character of AJAY does not provide much insight into the suffering that Roland is feeling. However, Roland does suffer from depression and has decided to spend less time hunting. This may be due to the fact that he has been hunting with AJAY for a long time and has lost interest in the activity. He may have been suffering from a loss of interest in hunting and has decided to try something new to try and find a new interest.
