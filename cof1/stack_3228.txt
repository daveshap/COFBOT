This person is suffering from an inability to remember the name of a story they read in the 1980's. It is possible that this story is part of the Lycanthrope mythos created by Robert E. Howard (see Project Gutenberg). If this is the case, the title may be "What Shall Be Born". However, there is also a possibility that this person is suffering from some form of dementia. They may need some help in the event that their memory loss is due to this.
