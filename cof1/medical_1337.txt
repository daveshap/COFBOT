This person suffers from two conditions. The first is cervical dystonia. This is a neurological disorder in which there is involuntary muscle spasming with twisting and turning of the neck. The second is post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome. This is a syndrome in which there is chronic pain in the neck with little or no known cause. The patient seems to have had some relief from this pain after a botulinum toxin injection. It is likely that she is still in pain though since her muscle spasms are present on the left side. We are going to have her have another botulinum toxin injection in order to reduce her pain further. It is also possible that she may have depression and anxiety. This is causing her to feel frustrated with her pain and she is likely to be experiencing some level of cognitive impairment. She has been given some medication to help with depression, but it may be necessary for her to begin some form of psychotherapy in order to reduce her symptoms.
