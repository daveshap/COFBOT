This person is suffering from the fact that house prices are rising at a rate that is too quickly for them to keep up. They are probably not really suffering from the fact that they are not making any money, but are instead unhappy with the fact that they are not making enough money to afford a house. This person should try to find a way to make more money. They should also try to find a way to make themselves feel better about their situation. Perhaps talking about their situation with others could help them feel better.
