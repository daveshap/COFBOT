This person is suffering from a loss of motivation and a feeling of isolation. This is a classic example of a person pushing off work and then feeling bad about it. There are two ways to solve this problem. First, the person needs to do their work and not procrastinate. Second, they need to talk to their colleagues and express their frustration and ask for help. They should not be "answerable to their department", as they should not feel like they are an indentured servant. They should enjoy their job and feel like they are contributing to the world around them.
