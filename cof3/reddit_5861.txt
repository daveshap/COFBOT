This person needs to learn about their feelings. For instance, they need to know how they feel about their current job. Do they like it, or not like it? What would cause them to like or dislike it? It is important that they understand that they could feel differently about a job after they have gained more skills and experience. They could also feel differently about a job if they were to study abroad at a higher quality university. It is important that they understand that the decision depends on how they feel, not what they think.
