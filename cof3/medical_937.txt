This person is asking about the specific procedure he is about to undergo. This is a fairly long procedure, so he may be frightened about the upcoming surgery. The patient is mostly asking about the procedure itself, but he does mention several salient points about his health. He has trouble voiding and has suspected bladder cancer. The patient mentions that he has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. He also mentions that he has no interest in the procedure and that he doesn't want to wake up in the morning. This information is important. The patient needs to understand his health problems and their possible solutions. He should be encouraged to ask more questions.
