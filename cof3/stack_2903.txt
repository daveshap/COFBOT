This person wants to understand what happens to information in a black hole. They believe that the gravitational effect will carry on outside the event horizon. This is a hard question to answer. A black hole event horizon has a gravitational pull that is so strong that nothing can escape. They may benefit from reading a book about black holes. Some books to consider include, Black Holes and Time Warps by Kip Thorne, Black Holes and Warped Passages by Don Lincoln, and Einsteins Nightmare by Leonard Mlodinow.
