This person wants to understand why terrorism is so high on the US priority list. This is an important question. The person shares some statistics to bolster their claim, but they are likely cherry picked. We can see from the polls they cite, the vast majority of Americans view terrorism as a much more significant issue than science, education, or infrastructure. This is likely due to the mediaâ€™s presentation of terrorism. Also, it is likely due to our aversion to death, which is quite irrational. Nevertheless, this is an important question to answer. One way to answer this question is to look at the history of terrorism in the US.
