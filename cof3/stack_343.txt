If this problem were only happening on the cloud, the issue might have to do with the cloud's settings. It's possible that the cloud does not have Internet access. The cloud may also not have enough memory available, or the cloud could have been deleted. If the issue is the first one, the cloud needs to be set to download. If the issue is the second one, the cloud may need to be reinstalled.
