This person is seeking advice about a job, and has asked for advice from a social media platform. They do not understand the nature of their problem, and it is important for them to recognize that their problem is a job problem. They should try to recognize that they have a problem with a specific job, not a problem with jobs in general. This is a big concept, and they may benefit from a mentor, a therapist, or a trusted person to help them with this.
