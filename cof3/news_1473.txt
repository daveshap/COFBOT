The author of this passage wants to understand how to do her job well. She is comparing her job with other jobs, and has asked for advice and opinions on the matter. She does not mention why she is looking for advice, but like many people, she seeks advice when she is in danger and doesn't know how to cope. It seems that she is questioning her performance and her value to the company. She may not fully understand what her job entails, and how it is measured. She may not understand the broader social structure of her company, and like many people, she may not understand how to make her manager happy. She may not understand the types of pressure her manager is facing this year, or how he or she likes to be managed.
