Roxanne is being manipulative here by using the death of her husband and child as a way to get Willard to stay and have a drink with her. She is trying to elicit a reaction by telling a sad story. Willard knows this and is a bit annoyed that she would try to manipulate him. This is an opportunity to talk about the difference between a reaction and a response. Willard responds to her story by empathizing with her loss, but he does not act on her request. He leaves the room, instead.
