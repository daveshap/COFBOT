Some students and professionals do not understand how to advocate for themselves. This could be a problem if they do not negotiate for higher pay or a better job title. They may need to learn more about negotiation. They may need to learn about their legal rights. They may need to learn about their rights as a union member, or as a contract worker. They may need to become an active member of their local union. Perhaps they could learn about their rights as an employee through the United States Department of Labor.
