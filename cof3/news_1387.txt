This is a great example of using the passage to understand the issue further. The passage is clear, but the athlete is not speaking directly to the issue. The passage is written in third person. We see the athlete's name here, but not in the rest of the passage. The passage is relatively short, but it still does not provide many details. However, the passage gives some insight into the athlete's personality. She is a relatively high profile athlete, with a long history of injuries. She has a good understanding of her body and what it needs to be healthy. She also appears to be a team player. She is motivated by success, but she also understands the risks of pushing herself too hard.
