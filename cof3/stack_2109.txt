This person does not understand how to identify reference times. They wrote about Reichenbach's model of tense. However, they did not apply it to the passage. If you read the passage again, you can see that it is unclear about the reference time. The first clause states that the document describes a solution. The second clause states that the solution was applied. The second clause is not about the document, but about the solution. However, the writer is not sure why the present perfect is used in the first clause. That is, the writer is not sure about the reference time. They must learn how to apply Reichenbach's model of tense to this kind of text.
