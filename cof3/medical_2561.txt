The radiologist made a mistake. The patient had a recent diagnosis of breast cancer and had a biopsy. She is scheduled to see a surgeon and a medical oncologist. This means that she may have more cancer. There was a suspicious malignant area of enhancement, which is a possible tumor. Dedicated ultrasonography of the inferior aspect of the left breast should be performed at the 6:00 oâ€™clock, N+5.5 cm position for further evaluation of the mass. At that same time, ultrasonography of the remaining masses should also be performed. Hopefully the radiologist will be able to read this report again and revise their diagnosis.
