This person knows enough to be dangerous. They are using the scientific method, but they are interpreting the results in an un-scientific way. It is not clear if they understand statistics. If they don't, then either the linear model or the quadratic model could be better than the other. If they do understand statistics, then it would be better to use a non-linear model. For example, the response variable could be modeled with a logistic regression model. Using a logistic model to model the response variable would take into account the skewed nature of the response variable. A logistic model would take into account the fact that the values are in the range of 0 to 1, rather than in the range of 1 to 5. A logistic regression model would be more accurate than a linear or quadratic model.
