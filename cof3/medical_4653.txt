This is a medical case, and as such the patient needs to be medically evaluated. It is essential to gain information about the patient's medical history and the results of her previous medical tests. There may be an underlying medical cause for her symptoms. It is also important to understand what this patient's normal range of functioning is (what is normal and what is not for this patient). How does the patient function normally, and how does she function when she is ill?
