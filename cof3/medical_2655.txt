This person wants to understand their relationship with their mother. They say that their mother had hypertension, but do not state that they know that hypertension is a risk factor for preterm birth and for having a small baby.

They need to learn more about the risks associated with maternal age and hypertension, and how they might apply to this pregnancy.
