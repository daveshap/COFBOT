It appears Kafka has a lot to learn about how to be an employee, and how to function in the workplace environment. It would be helpful for him to learn about etiquette and protocol. He should also learn how to be punctual, and how to develop good relationships with his employer and coworkers.

He might benefit from reading about how to work in a corporate environment and how to become a manager figure.
