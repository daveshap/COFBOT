This person probably doesn't fully understand the difference between "private" and "public" space. They have a sense of entitlement to invade their roommate's private life. They should be encouraged to develop a sense of "privacy" and to respect the boundaries of others. For instance, they should learn about how to screen incoming calls, and to respect their roommate's time alone. They should be encouraged to have a peaceful, quiet space where they can be alone.
