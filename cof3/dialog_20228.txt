A good place to start with this passage is to learn the word infatuation. The passage says that one of them has it. This can be a feeling that is related to love, but it is not the same. When you are infatuated with someone, you become more like them, and you put them on a pedestal. However, this is not true love, because true love lasts longer than infatuation. It is possible that they are both infatuated with each other, but it is more likely that they are each in love with the other person. This passage suggests that they are in love.
