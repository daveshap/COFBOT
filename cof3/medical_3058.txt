This is a letter from a pediatric urologist to a family practitioner about a young boy. The urologist mentions a few important concepts that the family practitioner may need to know about. The urologist notes that the child has been seen in clinic. He also notes that the child has abdominal pain and that a renal scan shows no evidence of obstruction and that his bladder is functioning well. The urologist then recommends that the family practitioner refer the child to pediatric gastroenterology. He also mentions that the child's condition is not related to his detrusor muscle and that his condition is likely not related to a sensory abnormality. Another important concept is that the child has been on MiraLax and that he should stay on it.
