This person wants to understand why some professors are unwilling to allow them to take courses outside of their program. They want to understand the logic behind the behavior of these professors. This is an excellent question! The professors' decision to allow or disallow you to take courses outside of your program is based on many factors. It might be based on the availability of seats in the class, or whether or not they think you are qualified to take the course. It could be based on their personal feelings toward you, or your institution. It could be that they are restricted by rules or policies that allow or disallow students to take certain classes.
