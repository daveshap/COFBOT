This person wants to learn how to interview. They may want to ask the institution what the purpose of the interview is. Sometimes, interviewers ask questions that are not directly related to the job or field of study, for example, "How does a microwave oven work?" This could be a trick question. They may want to do a practice interview with a friend, or a trusted adult. They should learn about the school and the field of study, and practice answering questions about that. They should also learn how to prepare a resume and portfolio, and how to write an effective cover letter.
