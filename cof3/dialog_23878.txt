This person does not understand important details in their life and in the lives of their family members. For instance, they do not understand the potential danger in their children's obsession with a television program. They also do not understand why their children would be watching television at 5am. They need to understand the potential dangers of the media and the need to manage their children's media consumption. They also need to understand the developmental needs of children and how to foster this development. They need to understand the way in which their own childhood experiences have affected them and the way in which they parent.
