This passage is about an athleteâ€™s self-talk. All athletes do this, but not all athletes are aware that they are talking to themselves. Many athletes talk themselves into performing poorly, or not at all. This person is not doing this, which is great. They should be encouraged to continue their present self-talk. The passage also discusses the idea of luck. The person believes that luck is a major factor in his success. This is an interesting take on luck, but it is not correct. Luck may have played a role in his early success, but that is not true anymore. They are being successful because of hard work, determination, and grit.
