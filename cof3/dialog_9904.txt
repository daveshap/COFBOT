This passage is from a play, so it is hard to identify with Frances' character. It is also hard to see what the author is trying to say in this scenario. Regardless, it is easy to see that Frances is in a difficult situation. She has a therapist who is trying to help her, but is not listening to her. Perhaps they could benefit from a book on how to be a good therapist.
