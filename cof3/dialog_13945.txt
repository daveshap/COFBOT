This passage is between attorneys about an upcoming divorce. The attorneys are trying to understand what the client wants. At first glance it appears that the client wants to reconcile with their partner. However, this is merely a tactic. The client is hoping that the attorneys will convince their partner that they want to reconcile. The client is hoping that their partner will be more willing to divorce them if the client appears to want to reconcile. This is a classic example of what it means to be a Machiavellian.
