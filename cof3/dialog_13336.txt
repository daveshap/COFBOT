This passage is about a problem-solving exercise. This particular exercise is about decision-making under pressure, which is a skill that is essential in the medical field. The problem was that the patient is experiencing a panic attack, and the medical students are not sure how to help her. The medical students interpret the patient's silence as approval for their plan. However, the medical student who was playing the role of the patient did not know what was going on. He was not engaging in the dialogue. He was not interacting with the medical student players. This is a demonstration of how people need to be aware of their assumptions. He needs to understand that it is important to listen to patients and ask questions. He needs to understand that it is important to ask for patients' consent. He needs to be clear about his intentions with the patient.
