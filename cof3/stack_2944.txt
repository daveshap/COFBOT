This person does not understand why lenses and antennas cannot be used at RF and microwaves. They believe that it is due to the size of the lens and antenna, and the frequency response of the lens and antenna. Presently, they do not understand the basic principles that govern these devices. They need to understand that the index of refraction of air does change at microwave frequencies, and that at such frequencies the antenna becomes a waveguide. They need to understand that lenses and antennas can be used at optical frequencies.
