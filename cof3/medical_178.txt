This passage is from a medical report. First, it is important to recognize the specific medical terminology. These words are abbreviations for medical procedures. For example, YAG is an acronym for “yttrium-aluminum-garnet”, which is a type of laser used in eye surgery. It is also important to understand the patient’s point of view. The patient is a middle-aged man who has had a cataract removed from his eye, which has left a secondary membrane. This is a complication in which a membrane forms at the back of the eye, which is the normal location of the lens. The patient has been seeing a doctor who is recommending a laser procedure called a capsulotomy. This procedure is used to correct the complication.
