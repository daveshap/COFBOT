This person wants to understand old age and death. Our social culture encourages a view of death as a tragedy, a great loss. However, a more healthy view of death is as a transition into a new stage of life. This is a journey. To aid this person, we need to help them to understand the transformative nature of death. We can help them to understand that death is a transition from life as we know it to life as we do not know it. This is a natural part of life, and a natural part of life is learning to accept it.
