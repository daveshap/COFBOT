The passage is about an individual making a list of goals, and then achieving them. They mention that they did not know how to make money, or how to make realistic goals, or how to save money. They were nervous about starting their teaching career, but they did it. They did not give up. They did not give up on their dreams. They deserve to be congratulated for their hard work.
