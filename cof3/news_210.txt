This person wants to understand how to invest in gold. One thing they don't fully understand is the relationship between supply and demand. They need to understand that supply is not something that can be changed easily. The other thing they need to understand is that the price of gold is not fixed. They are getting confused by the fact that the IMF says it values gold at $40-$50 an ounce, but the market price is much higher.
