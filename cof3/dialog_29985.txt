This passage about a bar brawl is confusing. However, there is a lot of information embedded in the text. First, the use of profanity is a sign of emotional intensity. This is a natural response to the situation, but the intensity is unnecessary. The use of profanity shows that the speaker is feeling some sort of pressure. When the pressure builds, the speaker gets angry. He wants to vent his anger, so he starts to curse. He says “son of a bitch” first, which is also a sign of emotional intensity, but it is milder than “mother fucker” or “fucker”. This is because he is on the verge of losing control, but he is trying to contain his anger. Instead of karate kicking someone, he says “tear you a new asshole”. This is also a sign of emotional intensity; however, this phrase shows that the speaker is getting frustrated. He wants to hurt someone but he can't, so he is getting creative. He wants to hurt someone in a way that they will never forget. He wants to tear someone's ass in two, but he can't do that, so he's going to tear someone's ass. This is the same type of anger that builds up in a person who has ever been cheated on or lied to.
