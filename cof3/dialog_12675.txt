This person wants to understand her feelings and understand her situation. She wants to understand why the police officer is being so rude to her. She may have some cognitions that are leading to her feelings, such as "I will never be understood." or "I will never be understood by this officer." It is important to help her think about the situation more clearly by asking questions such as "Do you understand why he is being rude to you?" and "Do you have a right to ask him questions?"
