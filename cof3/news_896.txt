This is a great example of the type of passage we discussed earlier regarding the "cause". This person is wondering how to make it in Hollywood. They want to know why they can't make it and how to make it in Hollywood. The topics of interest and the cause (why it is they can't make it in Hollywood) are intertwined in this passage. It is important to ask both.
