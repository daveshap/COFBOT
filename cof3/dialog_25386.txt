Kirk is in a precarious position here. Kirk may be trying to hide his true intentions, and also defend his honor and reputation. Kirk may face legal charges and is attempting to use his skills of persuasion to influence his interrogator. Kirk is in a dangerous situation and must think quickly. This is a good opportunity for the interrogator to use the skill of empathy. The interrogator can empathize with Kirk and relate to his situation. The interrogator will need to be careful not to appear to be on the same side as Kirk. The interrogator may need to take a non-judgmental stance, while also being direct.
