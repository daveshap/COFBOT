This question is a very basic statistical question. I’ve written a lengthy blog post on how to approach this topic. This person is learning statistics for the first time. They need to understand how to interpret statistical tests. They should understand what kind of test they should use, and why. They should also know about the Bonferroni correction. I don’t know if this person needs to learn more about statistics, or if they just need to read the results of their analysis more carefully.
