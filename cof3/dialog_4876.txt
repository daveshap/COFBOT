Buddy does not understand the meaning of the word gay. He also does not understand the meaning of the word ravenous, but that is less important. Buddy is not knowledgeable enough to understand the impact of his behavior on his life. This is not surprising since most people are not. The government should work with him to educate him. They should also offer him support to learn how to behave in a socially acceptable way.
