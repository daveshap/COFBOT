This article is difficult to understand. It might benefit from additional context. For instance, it is unclear what the problem is with Beijingâ€™s traffic. One might think that the problem is that there are too many cars, but it is also possible that there are too many cars with drivers who are not skilled at driving. This is a complex system, so it may be difficult to understand without more information. It is also possible that the problem is that the city is not designed well for vehicular traffic. For instance, if there is a big difference between the price of indoor parking and outdoor parking, drivers are likely to use the cheaper option. Drivers must have a choice.
