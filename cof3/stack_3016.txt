This person does not understand the nature of the Airy disk. When they describe seeing disk, they are referring to the phenomenon of seeing a bright ring when looking at a bright point source. The central disk is the brightest part of the light circle in the diffraction pattern. They are asking if the Airy disk is the same as the seeing disk. The Airy disk is the central disk in the diffraction pattern when you are looking at a circular aperture. With the seeing disk, the bright ring is when you are looking at a point source.
